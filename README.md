# find-distance-on-earth

Hello, this is a project which utalizes API access aswell as Java resources and several imported projects in order to find the distance 
between 2 areas on earth. It is not just a simple distance formula. It formulates in regards to the earths curvature and utalizes longituide
and latitude of each point to create a reliable distance that correctly feeds back the distance to the user! This project also uses
javas most reliable GUI platform SWING to create a GUI a user can interact with and actually use. This project is fully built in java.

# The API

For this specific project I used OpenWeatherApps API. Although it may sound irrelevant because of it being a weather app, it does contain data 
to the Latitudes and Longtitudes of each location since it feeds of locations. You can sign up here ---> https://openweathermap.org/ 
Just click sing up and it is fully free usage (differs between consistency and intensity of use). It provides you with an API key that is directly
what this project is built on and provides all the import information.

# The BASICS

For this project I used Java Swing
